In Simulation.mlx you can solve the magnetostatics problem in the initial configuration (without any rotation)

In diff_rotations.m you can solve the problem for different rotation angles of the rotor and an animation is made of that.

In the folder Animations, animation files are stored. You can ran an animation by calling "movie(figure,animFile,n,fps)" where animFile is the corresponding file and n is how often the animation should be repeated. fps are the frames per second.

See also the documentation in the files. If something is not clear, just ask :)
